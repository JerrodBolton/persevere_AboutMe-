        <p>This is a website that is all about me and things that I like to do in my life.
            I know that you’re asking the question “Who are you?” Well hey, my name is <strong>Jerrod Bolton</strong>,
            and I'm from <strong> Memphis </strong>. I went to school at Freedom Preparatory High School, and I graduate
            in 2019.
            In school, I was a hand working student who gave my all. I worked tirelessly to get all of my
            work done in class and outside of class. When things got hard I stop and think about the ways that I
            could make things easy. I’m say this because I have a disability. I have a reading disorder call dyslexic,
            but that doesn’t stop me I keep going. In the summer of 2019 and I started college, yes reading and writing
            in
            college classes, this was one of the most different things that I have ever done. However, I did them well
            the most enthusiasm. Too fast forward to today, I’m doing a coding boot camp, and I thought college was
            hard. This is
            nothing compared to college the material is a headache in itself. Everyday the
            possibility become overwhelm versatile. The possibility are endless your imagination limit.
            I think this is the reason that I love coding so much. Well, that and the fact that when your code works
            it’s like a small firecracker parade that in your honor. Like I announce, this website is all about me
            and my experiences in my daily experiences.
